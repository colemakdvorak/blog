I am a first-year graduate student at Korea University’s school of Artificial Intelligence in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sungjoon-choi/home">Robot Intelligence Lab</a>. As a first-year student, my current research interests are relatively broad - I am interested in improving the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning techniques or finding representations for learning that are effective for solving robotic tasks across multiple domains.

Before starting my graduate degree, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.liftigniter.com/blog/our-new-chapter-begins">LiftIgniter</a>, a YC startup that provides recommendations as a service. At LiftIgniter, I spent most of my time delving into information retrieval, predictive analysis, and machine learning techniques related to recommendation systems, along with general software engineering and web architecture.

Prior to that, I completed BSc in Applied Mathematics and BA in Mathematics at Brown University. You can verify my credential <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/cediplomas/validate-diploma">here</a>. Use `15C0-B3DB-E2E3` for CeDiD code and `EU` for the first two letters of my name.

My life further back is complicated, so I’ll end here since we are running out of space; I was born in the United States, nurtured in Denmark, and raised in South Korea.
